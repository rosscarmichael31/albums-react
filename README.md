## React breakout one

Use the data from the lecture, provided in `week_7/breakout/data.js` of this repo to build a UI.

Your solution should do the following:

1. Display all albums
2. Allow the user to mark albums they have listened to
3. Allow the user to add a new Album to the list
4. Allow the user to create a "wish list" of albums they want to buy
5. Allow the user to filter the albums based on genre
   - Add genre to the data
   - Provide a drop down box to the user that allows them to see only albums from a selected genre

## Stretch goal

- How does this look on a mobile phone?
- Can we build an "artist" page that shows all the albums for an artist?
